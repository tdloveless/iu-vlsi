# Syllabus for ENGR-E 399/599: Topics in Intelligent Systems Engineering, VLSI Design

## Course Description:  
VLSI Design introduces students to fabrication and layout techniques for designing large-scale integrated circuits (ICs) and systems. Students will use industry-standard tools for designing and fabricating ICs in nanometer-scale technology nodes. Specific topics include MOSFET and FinFET theory, CMOS logic, standard fabrication processes, layout design rules, and all the factors required for a practical circuit design. Analog and digital design techniques for creating static and dynamic logic structures, interconnect analysis, chip layout, simulation, and testing will be explored.

## Course Pre/Co-Requisites:

## Required materials:

* All course reference materials are supplied in-class and on the course GitHub page.
* No software purchases are required; VLSI Design will utilize the Cadence Design electronic design automation (EDA) tool suite. The Cadence EDA is a high-quality, industry-standard tool heavily used to design and simulate integrated circuits. We will be using the Cadence Design System for circuit schematic design (Virtuoso), simulation (Spectre), circuit layout (Virtuoso), and verification (Pegasus). Information about Cadence can be found [here](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/layout-design/virtuoso-layout-suite.html).
* Cadence is installed on the burrow-rhel server at IU. You will be given accounts on this Red Hat Linux system and can access it via the classroom (IF 4111) or remotely through IU's VPN. More information on the main [README](../README.md#running-cadence)
* All course material will be published to <https://github.com/tdloveless/iu-vlsi>
* Note that Canvas will only be used to publish grades and links to submit assignments. Students are expected to supply a personal working laptop computer with permissions to install and use course software.

**VLSI Design**

**Homework 6 (Tapeout Readiness Review - TRR)**

**Due Date:** May 1, 2025 @ 12:45pm

**Objective:**  
To develop and present a Tapeout Readiness Review (TRR) for a VLSI design project, demonstrating completed design and readiness for fabrication.

### Instructions

**Provide a PPTX presentation with the following structure:**

- **Title Slide - 1 slide**: Project title, your name, course name, and date.
- **Project Overview - 1 slide:** Briefly revisit the scope and objectives of your project.
- **Design Specification - 1 slide**: Reiterate the design requirements and target specifications.
- **Final Design - 2 slides**: Update initial design schematics, block diagrams, and simulations or calculations. Include any changes or improvements since the CDR.
- **Layout â€” 2-3 slides**: Present the layout of your design, which should be 100% completed. Highlight key components and their placement. Discuss any layout considerations and constraints.
- **DRC and LVS**: Provide evidence that your design is DRC and LVS clean. If you have remaining DRC errors, provide a table of these rules and a justification for waiving them (if necessary) or why these remain unsolved.

**Content Requirements**:
- Use clear and concise language.
- Include visuals such as diagrams, charts, and tables to support your points.
- Ensure all technical details are accurate and well-explained.

**Submission**:
- Submit your PowerPoint presentation file by May 1.
- Ensure your file is named appropriately (e.g., "TRR_Presentation_YourName.pptx").

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Content Quality**: Accuracy and completeness of the design review.
- **Layout Progress**: Quality and completeness of the layout (100% completed).
- **Visual Aids**: Effective use of diagrams, charts, and other visuals.

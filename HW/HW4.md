**VLSI Design**

**Homework 4 (Preliminary Design Review - PDR)**

**Due Date:** Apr. 22, 2025 @ 12:45pm

**Objective:** 
To develop and present a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for a VLSI design project, demonstrating understanding of design principles, methodologies, and project planning.

### Instructions
**Provide a PPTX presentation with the following structure:**
- **Title Slide - 1 slide**: Project title, your name, course name, and date.
- **Project Overview - 1 slide:** Define the scope and objectives of your approved project.  What are you trying to accomplish and why?
- **Design Specification - 1 slide**: Description of the design requirements and target specifications.
- **Design Methodology - 1 slide**: Outline the design process, including tools and techniques used.
- **Preliminary Design - 2-3 slides**: Present initial design schematics, block diagrams, and simulations or calculations. Layout is not required in a PDR, but if you have any preliminary layout, you can provide it. Simulations of desired performance are requisite. Also, the testability of the design should be considered. If fabricated, how will you measure and verify performance?
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Discuss potential challenges and proposed solutions.
- **Project Timeline**: Provide a timeline for the project, including milestones and deadlines.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize the key points and next steps.

**Content Requirements**:
   - Use clear and concise language.
   - Include visuals such as diagrams, charts, and tables to support your points.
   - Ensure all technical details are accurate and well-explained.

**Submission**:
   - Submit your PowerPoint presentation file by Mar. 22.
   - Ensure your file is named appropriately (e.g., "PDR_Presentation_YourName.pptx").

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Content Quality**: Accuracy and completeness of the design review.
- **Visual Aids**: Effective use of diagrams, charts, and other visuals.

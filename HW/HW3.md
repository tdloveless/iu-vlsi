Due Date:** Apr. 1, 2025 @ 12:45 pm

**Description:** Final Project Proposal

**Associated Reading Material:** N/A

**Detail:** For this assignment, prepare a short description/proposal for your final VLSI design
project. The proposal should include a project summary, problem statement, proposed solution,
design methodology, a list of team members, and a timeline with milestones.

A more detailed breakdown of what to include in your VLSI design project proposal is as follows:

**1. Project Summary (1 paragraph):**
- Briefly describe the project: What problem are you trying to solve, and what is the proposed solution?
- Highlight the significance: Why is this project important, and what do you expect to get from it (impact, benefits, learning objectives, etc.)?
- Outline the scope: What are the key features and functionalities of the proposed design?

**2. Problem Statement (1 paragraph):**
- Clearly define the general problem
- What circuit(s) do you intend to design? 
- Why is this important for your chosen problem/design?
- This should be slightly more detailed than the overview (sentence) in the project summary.

**3. Proposed Solu9on/Design Methodology (1-2 paragraphs):**
- Describe the design. How does the proposed solution address the identified problem?
- Explain the functionality: What are the key functions and features of the proposed design?
- Justify the approach: Why is this solution the best for addressing the problem?

**5. Tools and Techniques ( 1 paragraph):**
- List the EDA tools: What software will be used for design, synthesis, and layout?
- Describe the design methodologies: What design styles and techniques will be employed?
- Explain the simulation and verification tools: How will the design be verified and validated?

**6. Timeline and Milestones (List):**
- Create a realistic timeline, remembering that the final layout and simulation results must be delivered during the last week of the semester. What are the key milestones and deadlines for the project?
- Outline the deliverables: What are each milestone's key outputs and deliverables?
- Plan for contingencies: What are the potential risks and challenges, and how will they be addressed?

**7. Team Member(s) (List):**
- List contributors and indicate what each person will be responsible for.

**8. Additional Sections (*Optional*):**
- Block Diagram: A visual design representation showing the different modules and their connections.
- References: List any relevant publications or resources.
